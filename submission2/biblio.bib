	abstract = {Perivascular spaces (PVS) are important highways for fluid and solute transport in the brain enabling efficient waste clearance during sleep. Using two-photon imaging of naturally sleeping mice we demonstrate sleep cycle-dependent PVS dynamics {\textendash} slow, large-amplitude oscillations in NREM, a reduction in REM and an enlargement upon awakening at the end of a sleep cycle. By biomechanical modeling we demonstrate that these sleep cycle-dependent PVS dynamics drive fluid flow and solute transport.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    ISSN={1662-5188},   
    ABSTRACT={The Multiple-Network Poroelastic Theory (MPET) is a numerical model to characterize the transport of multiple fluid networks in the brain, which overcomes the problem of conducting separate analyses on individual fluid compartments and losing the interactions between tissue and fluids, in addition to the interaction between the different fluids themselves. In this paper, the blood perfusion results from MPET modeling are partially validated using cerebral blood flow (CBF) data obtained from arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses arterial blood water as an endogenous tracer to measure CBF. Two subjects—one healthy control and one patient with unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis are included in the validation test. The comparison shows several similarities between CBF data from ASL and blood perfusion results from MPET modeling, such as higher blood perfusion in the gray matter than in the white matter, higher perfusion in the periventricular region for both the healthy control and the patient, and asymmetric distribution of blood perfusion for the patient. Although the partial validation is mainly conducted in a qualitative way, it is one important step toward the full validation of the MPET model, which has the potential to be used as a testing bed for hypotheses and new theories in neuroscience research.}

ABSTRACT={In this paper, we used a computational model to estimate the clearance of a tracer driven by the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced in the choroid plexus (CP) located within the lateral ventricles. CSF was assumed to exit the subarachnoid space (SAS) via different outflow routes such as the parasagittal dura, cribriform plate, and/or meningeal lymphatics. We also modelled a reverse case where fluid was produced within the spinal canal and absorbed in the choroid plexus in line with observations on certain iNPH patients. No directional interstitial fluid flow was assumed within the brain parenchyma. Tracers were injected into the foramen magnum. The models demonstrate that convection in the subarachnoid space yields rapid clearance from both the SAS and the brain interstitial fluid and can speed up intracranial clearance from years, as would be the case for purely diffusive transport, to days.}

    abstract = {Aging or cerebral diseases may induce architectural modifications in human brain microvascular networks, such as capillary rarefaction. Such modifications limit blood and oxygen supply to the cortex, possibly resulting in energy failure and neuronal death. Modelling is key in understanding how these architectural modifications affect blood flow and mass transfers in such complex networks. However, the huge number of vessels in the human brain—tens of billions—prevents any modelling approach with an explicit architectural representation down to the scale of the capillaries. Here, we introduce a hybrid approach to model blood flow at larger scale in the brain microcirculation, based on its multiscale architecture. The capillary bed, which is a space-filling network, is treated as a porous medium and modelled using a homogenized continuum approach. The larger arteriolar and venular trees, which cannot be homogenized because of their fractal-like nature, are treated as a network of interconnected tubes with a detailed representation of their spatial organization. The main contribution of this work is to devise a proper coupling model at the interface between these two components. This model is based on analytical approximations of the pressure field that capture the strong pressure gradients building up in the capillaries connected to arterioles or venules. We evaluate the accuracy of this model for both very simple architectures with one arteriole and/or one venule and for more complex ones, with anatomically realistic tree-like vessels displaying a large number of coupling sites. We show that the hybrid model is very accurate in describing blood flow at large scales and further yields a significant computational gain by comparison with a classical network approach. It is therefore an important step towards large scale simulations of cerebral blood flow and lays the groundwork for introducing additional levels of complexity in the future.},
